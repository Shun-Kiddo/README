Hi, I'm Jayson Flores Mancol—a humble and curious developer-in-training with a passion for technology and learning. 
My main programming languages are React.js, Node.js, Express.js,Tailwind.css, JavaScript, Java, Kotlin, SQL and a bit of Python. 
I also enjoy hardware troubleshooting, robotics projects, and building websites.

Some of my recent work includes:
- **Web Development**
- **Mobile Development**
- **ESP32-based IoT Projects**
- **Graphic Design**

I’m always eager to explore new tools and approaches. 
Outside of tech, I love motorcycles and enjoy discovering how things work.
