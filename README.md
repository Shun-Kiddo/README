Hi, I'm Jayson Flores Mancol—a humble and curious developer-in-training with a passion for technology and learning. 
My main programming languages are SQL, Java, JavaScript, and a bit of Python. 
I also enjoy hardware troubleshooting, robotics projects, and building websites.

Some of my recent work includes:
- **Learning Management System (LMS)** – My thesis project
- **Inventory Management System (IMS)**
- **ESP32-based IoT Projects**

I’m always eager to explore new tools and approaches. 
Outside of tech, I love motorcycles and enjoy discovering how things work.
